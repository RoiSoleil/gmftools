#summary A set of UI extensions for the Eclipse workbench to facilitate working with GMF.

= GMFTools =

We have written an action that can be executed via a toolbar button. You must select a GMF model file the first time you trigger it. All subsequent executions will use the selected file or the last one, if the selection is not a suitable GMF file. The following subactions are executed in the given order

 # Delete existing gmfgen model to avoid reconciliation
 # Generate a new gmfgen model from the mapping model
 # Create a new gmfgen transformation if it does not already exist
 # Transform the generated gmfgen model into a customized version
 # Harmonize type registrations in all active customized gmfgen models. This list is automatically filled when the action is called on a new GMF model. It can be maintined/changed in the properties section.
 # Delete the existing diagram editor plug-in
 # Generate the diagram code.

The subactions can be enabled/disabled individually on a preference page. Alternatively, the subactions 3, 4, and 5 are available as popup menu actions.
